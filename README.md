# Gravity Perk - Focus on First Error

With a huge thanks to David Smith for creating the initial code, this Gravity Perk adds a settings field to each Gravity Form that will force a users viewport to scroll to the first validation error, if the settings field is checked.

See https://gravitywiz.com/make-gravity-forms-validation-errors-mobile-friendlyer/ for the original script.
